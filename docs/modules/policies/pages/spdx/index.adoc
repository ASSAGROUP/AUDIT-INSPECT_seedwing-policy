Functions and patterns for SPDX

[#compatible]
== `compatible<license_id>`

All the licenses identifiers must be in the SPDX format.

https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2-draft/SPDX-license-list/

The list of known licenses must be given as a parameter. A single good license is also accepted.

Example:

[source]
----
pattern only-copyleft = spdx::compatible<["OSL-2.0", "GPL-2.0", "CC-BY-SA-2.0"]>

The following input would fail:

[source,json]
----
"MIT OR Apache-2.0"
----

[#license-expr]
== `license-expr`

https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2-draft/SPDX-license-list/

Example:
