Functionality for processing base64 encoded data

[#base64]
== `base64`

Applies Base64 decoding on a string input, resulting in a sequence of octets.

==== Simple base64 encoded value

Validates the base64 string and transforms it into the BLOB.

==== Non-base64 encoded value

Fails to validate, as it is not a base64 encoded value

[source,json]
----
"foo bar"

[#base64-encode]
== `base64-encode`

Applies Base64 encoding on octet input, resulting in a base64 encoded string.

[#base64-url]
== `base64-url`

Applies Base64 URL-safe decoding on a string input, resulting in a sequence of octets.
