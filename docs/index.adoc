== Seedwing

`Seedwing-Policy` is a type/pattern/function-based _policy engine_ which can be embedded in another process, or accessed over REST APIs.
The general idea of a policy engine is that a consumer requiring a decision presents the information they have available, and the policy engine inspects the information, possibly transforming or augmenting it, to provide a decision as to if the inputs represent compliance or violation of the policy.

Additionally, Seedwing provides detailed explanations of the decision process.

The Seedwing engine includes link:/policy/[core patterns] to assist in policy authoring.
Some examples include:

* Sigstore
* x509
* CycloneDX
* SPDX
* Maven
* Base64

=== Language

Policies are defined in terms of _patterns_ which match input value types.
Generally the inputs may be JSON or other handy serialized formats.
The patterns are defined in a format-agnostic way using the _Dogma_ policy language.

For more information about the *Dogma* policy language, please reference to the link:language/[Language Reference].

=== Engine

The core policy engine is simply a Rust library, which can be embedded or used by other processes as needed.
The engine includes the parsing and compiling of the Dogma language into executable policies.
