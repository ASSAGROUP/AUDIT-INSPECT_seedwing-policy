# Seedwing Policy

A nascent attempt at a simpler alternative to
https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[OPA/Rego], which can be a bit tedious
and overgeneralized. It may go nowhere, but if it works,
https://github.com/seedwing-io/seedwing-proxy[seedwing-proxy] should
be able to use it as an alternative to OPA.
