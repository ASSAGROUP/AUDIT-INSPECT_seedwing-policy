== Seedwing Policy Server

The Seedwing Policy Server provides a collection of HTTP endpoints to allow remote evaluation of your policy patterns.

To run the server, you can use the `swio` tool, or using pre-made docker images.

We also host a policy server at link:https://playground.seedwing.io[], which you can use to experiment with policies.

To run the policy server on link:https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes], have a look at the link:https://github.com/seedwing-io/playground.seedwing.io[github repository] for the playground for example manifests.
